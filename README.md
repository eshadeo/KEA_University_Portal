# KEA_University_Portal

We have created a prototype of a working college website portal using features of Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures. The program includes tabs like College Events, Syllabus, Placement Records etc. A user can interact and get information about these various aspects of the college directly through the portal. This helps keep track of all current activity taking place on a monthly basis in the college.

To replicate the experience of a user with roles such as Students, Parents, Visitors etc and
administration , we have created 2 separate views with accessibility privileges.
As a viewer , you can only view and peek the following features:
1. Syllabus
2. Study Material
3. Events
4. Placements
As an admin, you can not only view but also edit these features:
1. Syllabus
2. Study Material
3. Events
4. Placements
